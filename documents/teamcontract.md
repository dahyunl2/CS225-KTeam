# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

We are planning to meet in-person once or twice for about 2 hours every week, and hold additional virtual meetings if necessary. We will be taking outlines of each meeting so that we can reference it while making
the development log.
2. **Assistance** 

We will primarily use a group chat to exchange ideas and contact other members. All members are expected to respond within 1~2 hours. 

3. **Respect** 

While having a group meeting, we can encourage every member to participate by taking turns to make new suggestions or  revisions on the algorithm. All members should be actively listening to other's thoughts to find solutions for the given task.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
Firstly, during the designing and planning steps, we will meet and discuss the things together.
After the plan made, we will split the workload equally and do the work individually for one week. Then we will have weekly meeting to share dificulties and discuss the solutions. Also, we will cumulate the works at weekly meeting. Specific workload is not decided yet. 

5. **Time Commitment** 
We are planning to work individual 6-8 hours a week and do 1hour weekly meeting. 
If the week is a heavy week (such as having 2-3 midterms), we will adjust the workload. In case if a member can't accomplish his or her part completely, we will keep asking for status report so that we can help each other.


6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We have an active group chat, so we are not expecting any late or miscoumication. But if it happens and we cannot solve the conflict by ourselves, we will ask a help to TA. In case if one of the member have problems such as not doing the task or habitually late, we will report this to our mentor(TA) to get a better solution.
